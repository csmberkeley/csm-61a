\question Implement \lstinline$pow_of_two$, which takes in an integer \lstinline$n$ and
prints all the positive, integer powers of two less than or equal to n. This function should return \lstinline$None$.

\textit{Follow up question: What would you change about your solution if the question asked to print all the powers of two \textbf{strictly less than} \lstinline$n$?}
\begin{lstlisting}
def pow_of_two(n):
    """
    >>> pow_of_two(6)
    1
    2
    4
    >>> result = pow_of_two(16)
    1
    2
    4
    8
    16
    >>> result is None
    True

\begin{solution}[2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    curr = 1
    while curr <= n:
        print(curr)
        curr *= 2 # equivalent to curr = curr * 2
\end{lstlisting}
Since we are multiplying curr by 2 on each iteration of the while loop, curr holds values that are powers of 2.
Notice that since there is no return statement in this function, when Python reaches the end of the function, it automatically returns None.

The answer to the follow up question is that the condition of our while loop would change to \lstinline$curr < n$.
Walk through the code for \lstinline$pow_of_two(16)$ with both of the conditions to see why they produce different outputs!

Another way you could have written this function is by using pow or the ** operator. That solution would look something like this where you would keep track of the exponent itself:

\begin{lstlisting}
    exponent = 0
    while (2 ** exponent) <= n:
        print(2 ** exponent)
        exponent += 1
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
