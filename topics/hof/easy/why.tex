\question Why and where do we use lambda and higher-order functions?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
In practice, we use lambda functions and higher-order functions to write short \emph{adapters} programs, or functions that help us connect two programs together. In the \emph{Maps} project, you'll have an opportunity to \emph{adapt} a particular problem, predicting user ratings, to general machine learning algorithms.
