\question Why and where do we use lambda and higher-order functions? Can you give a practical example of where we would use a HOF?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
In practice, we use lambda functions to pass code as data in a concise manner. One specific example to illustrate the use of lambdas is the optional \lstinline{key} parameter for \lstinline{min} and \lstinline{max} functions.
Higher order functions serve as a tool of abstraction, allowing us to simplify repeated actions into one function that we can use over and over again, also referred to as currying.
Students can have varying answers for practice uses of HOFs, though here are some suggestions for the average student coming across this worksheet:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our method signature is composed of one parameter, but we wish to use a higher order function with more parameters to abstract extra steps.
    \item When our function is long and complex; easier to read code when it's organized into several different higher order functions.
\end{itemize}
