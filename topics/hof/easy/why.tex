\question Why and where do we use lambda and higher-order functions?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
In practice, we use lambda functions to pass code as data in a concise manner. One specific example to illustrate the use of lambdas is the optional \lstinline{key} parameter for \lstinline{min} and \lstinline{max} functions.
Higher order functions serve as a tool of abstraction, allowing us to simplify repeated actions into one function that we can use over and over again, also referred to as currying.
