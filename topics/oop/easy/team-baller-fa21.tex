\textbf{Teaching Tips}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Let students think about what methods are being inherited, along with the attributes that are inherited in the init method.
    \item Remember that although the pass\_ball method will be overridden in the TeamBaller method, it can call the inherited class's method.
    \item Remember that the pass\_ball method of the Baller class will return whether the ball was passed or not, which decides whether the TeamBaller instance should cheer or not.
