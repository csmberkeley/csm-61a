\textbf{Inheritance} is an important feature of object oriented programs. In addition to making our code more concise, it allows us to create classes based on other classes in a similar way to how real-world categories are often divided into smaller subcategories. 

For example, the \lstinline{HybridCar} class may inherit from the \lstinline{Car} class: 

\begin{lstlisting}
class HybridCar(Car):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.battery = 100

    def drive(self):
        super().drive()
        self.battery -= 5
        print("Current battery level:", self.gas)

    def brake(self):
        self.battery += 1

my_hybrid = HybridCar()
\end{lstlisting}

By default, the child class inherits all of the attributes and methods of its parent class. So from the \lstinline{HybridCar} instance \lstinline{my_hybrid}, we can call \lstinline{my_hybrid.drive()} and access \lstinline{my_hybrid.wheels}, for example. When dot notation is used on an instance, Python will first check the instance to see if the attribute exists, then the instance's class, and then its parent class, etc. If Python goes all the way up the class tree without finding the attribute, an \lstinline{AttributeError} is thrown. 

Additional or redefined instance and class attributes can be added in a child class. We can also \textbf{override} inherited instance methods by redefining them in the child class. If we would like to call the parent class's version of a method, we can use \lstinline{super()} to access it.
