\question Last week you used nonlocal to implement pingpong; now, let's use OOP!

As a reminder, the ping-pong sequence counts up starting from 1 and is
always either counting up or counting down.

At element k, the direction switches if k is a multiple of 7 or contains the
digit 7.

The first 30 elements of the ping-pong sequence are listed below, with direction
swaps marked using brackets at the 7th, 14th, 17th, 21st, 27th, and 28th
elements:
\begin{lstlisting}
1 2 3 4 5 6 [7] 6 5 4 3 2 1 [0] 1 2 [3] 2 1 0 [-1] 0 1 2 3 4
[5] [4] 5 6
\end{lstlisting}

Assume you have a function \texttt{has\_seven(k)} that returns True if $k$ contains the digit 7.

\begin{nonsol}
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> tracker1 = PingPongTracker()
>>> tracker2 = PingPongTracker()
>>> tracker1.next()
1
>>> tracker1.next()
2
>>> tracker2.next()
1

class PingPongTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current = 0
        self.index = 1
        self.add = True
    def next(self):
\end{lstlisting}
\end{nonsol}

\begin{solution}[0.3in]
\begin{lstlisting}
class PingPongTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current = 0
        self.index = 1
        self.add = True

    def next(self):
        if self.add:
            self.current += 1
        else:
            self.current -= 1
        if has_seven(self.index) or self.index % 7 == 0:
            self.add = not self.add
        self.index += 1
        return self.current

\end{lstlisting}
Notice how the OOP approach is insanely similar to the non local function.
Instead of using \texttt{nonlocal}, we use \texttt{self.varName} and the code
becomes exactly the same. We just store the data in a slightly different way.
This implies that OOP and functions are pretty similar, and it turns out you can
even write your own OOP framework using just functions and \texttt{nonlocal}!

In addition, there are a lot of python specific features that can be written
using functions or using classes. If you are interested, check out the powerful
python feature decorators, and note how we can write them both as functions and
as classes!
