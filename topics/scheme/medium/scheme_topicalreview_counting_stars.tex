\textbf{Counting Stars}
\question Alice goes out to look for shooting stars every evening and records how many she sees each evening. One day, she decides to write a Scheme program to figure out how many times she has seen a certain number of stars, and she asks you for help. She wants to put in her record as a Scheme list and return a new list with the number of stars and the number of times she saw that number of stars. Write the program that would satisfy Alice’s request.

\begin{lstlisting}
; Doctests
> (counter 4 ‘(1 3 2 3 4 4 7) 0)
(4 2)
> (counter 6 ‘(1 2 3 4 5) 0)
(6 0)
> (counter 3 ‘(1 2 3 4 5) 0)
(3 1)

(define (counter x lst count)





)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (counter x lst count)
    (cond
        ((equal? lst nil) (cons x (cons count nil))
        ((equal? x (car lst)) (counter x (cdr lst) (+ count 1)))
        (else (counter x (cdr lst) count))
    )
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
