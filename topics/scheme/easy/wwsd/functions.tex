\question What will Scheme output?

\begin{lstlisting}
scm> (define c 2)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.25in]
\begin{lstlisting}
c
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
scm> (eval 'c)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.25in]
\begin{lstlisting}
2
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{guide}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item In this case, there's a similar behavior to Python
	\item Emphasize the importance of short circuiting -- it will be very important for the Scheme project
	\end{itemize}

\begin{blocksection}
	\begin{lstlisting}
	scm> (define (factorial n)
			(if (= n 0)
				1
				(* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
	\end{lstlisting}
	\begin{solution}[.25in]
	\texttt{factorial}
	\end{solution}
	
	\begin{lstlisting}
	scm> (factorial 5)
	\end{lstlisting}
	\begin{solution}[.25in]
	\texttt{120}

	\textbf{Teaching Tips}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item We can compare this factorial implementation in Scheme to the Python interpretation so that the students can see how the \lstinline{define} keyword works
	  \item If your students are not caught up with lecture/have had no practice with Scheme, try drawing parallels between control statements in Scheme and Python.

\textbf{Teaching Tips}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Quotation marks are easily one of the trickiest concepts in Scheme, so spend a lot of time making sure your students understand these problems thoroughly! It would help to do a quick mini lecture or review of quotation marks if your students need.
	\item In some cases it is easier to think of the single quotation mark as double quotes in Python that encompass a string, such as in "standalone" expressions like the third one. In such cases the exact "string" is returned
	\item Encourage students to make the connection between Scheme lists and Scheme expressions as often as they can. Being able to read Scheme expressions as lists will be very helpful in the future.
	\item Whenever there is an eval with a quote, you go down one level of evaluation and essentially pretend the quote is not there.
	\item Going off of the third point, it could be beneficial to model Scheme expressions on a pyramid of evaluation: exact string, evaluating the string, etc.
