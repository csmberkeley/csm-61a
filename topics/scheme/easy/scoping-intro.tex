\question What is the difference between dynamic and lexical scoping?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lexical:} The parent of a frame is the frame in which a
        procedure was defined (used in Python).
    \item \textbf{Dynamic:} The parent of a frame is the frame in which a
        procedure is called (keep an eye out for this in the Scheme project).
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}
