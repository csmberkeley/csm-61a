\question What would this print using lexical scoping? What would it print using
dynamic scoping?

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
a = 2
def foo():
    a = 10
    return lambda x: x + a
bar = foo()
bar(10)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.25in]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lexical:} 20
    \item \textbf{Dynamic:} 12
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

\question How would you modify an environment diagram to represent dynamic
scoping?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Assign parents when you create a frame (do not set parents when defining
functions!). The parent in this case is the frame in which you called this
function.
\end{solution}
