\question 
    You're writing a plot outline for a fantasy novel. Each plot point 
    consists of a character and an event theyâ€™re involved in.
    Define a function build-plot-outline that takes two lists: 
        A list of characters (symbols), A list of events (symbols)

    The function should return a list of plot points, where each plot point 
    is a pair (character . event), following these rules:

    Plot points are created by pairing the first character with the first event, the second with the second, and so on.
    If one list is longer than the other, ignore the extra elements.
    If any character or event is 'plot-hole, skip that pairing entirely.

        scm> (build-plot-outline '(dragon knight) '(flight plot-hole))
        ((dragon . flight))

        scm> (build-plot-outline '(plot-hole) '(plot-hole))
        ()

        scm> (build-plot-outline '() '(event1 event2))

        (define (build-plot-outline characters events)

                    (else
                    (let ((c (car characters))
                        (e (car events)))
                    (if (__________________________)
                        (build-plot-outline (__________________________) (__________________________))
