\question Imagine we have a game where there are multiple cards with numbers laid out in a straight line. 
Each turn, a player can take a card from the very left, or the very right. 
\newline
We want to write a function, \texttt{game}, that determines whether or not it is possible for a sequence of valid 
moves to result in both players getting an equal score once all cards are used.
\newline
We represent the cards as a list. Say \texttt{lst = [0, 2, 2, 4]}. In this case, our function should return True. 
The current player (\texttt{curr}) can pick the last card (4) on their first turn. After that, the two players switch. 
On the next turn, the new current player (previously the opponent) can pick 2. Then the original player picks 0, 
and the other player picks 2.
\newline
\texttt{Game} takes in the scores of both players (initially 0) and a list representing the cards.
\newline
\begin{lstlisting}
def game(cards):
    """
    >>> game([1,2,3]) #1, then 3, then 2
    True
    >>> game([1, 1, 1])
    False
    >>> game([])
    True
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
def game_helper(curr, opp, lst):
   if not lst:
      return curr == opp
   else:
      return game(opp, curr + lst[0], lst[1:]) or game(opp, curr + lst[-1], lst[:-1])
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
