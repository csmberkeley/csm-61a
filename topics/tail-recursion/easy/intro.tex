\question What is a tail context? What is a tail call? What is a tail recursive function?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
A tail call is a call expression in a tail context. A tail context is usually the final action of a procedure/function.
\newline
A tail recursive function is where all the recursive calls of the function are in tail contexts. \newline
\newline
An ordinary recursive function is like building up a long chain of domino pieces, then knocking down the last one. A tai
l recursive function is like putting a domino piece up, knocking it down, putting a domino piece up again, knocking it d
own again, and so on. This metaphor helps explain why tail calls can be done in constant space, whereas ordinary recursi
ve calls need space linear to the number of frames (in the metaphor, domino pieces are equivalent to frames).
\end{solution}

\question Why are tail calls useful for recursive functions?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
When a function is tail recursive, it can effectively discard all the past recursive frames and only keep the current fr
ame in memory. This means we can use a constant amount of memory with recursion, and that we can deal with an unbounded
number of tail calls with our Scheme interpreter.
\end{solution}
