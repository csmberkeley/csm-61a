Dictionaries are another useful Python data structure that store a collection of items. However, instead of assigning each item a numerical index, each \textbf{value} in a dictionary is mapped to by some \textbf{key}. 

Dictionaries are denoted with curly braces and use much of the same syntax as sequences---including item selection with square brackets, membership testing with \lstinline{in}, and length checking with \lstinline{len}. Consider the following ``Big'' example:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> big_game_wins = {"Cal": 48, "Stanford": 65}
>>> big_game_wins 
{"Cal": 48, "Stanford": 65}
>>> big_game_wins["Stanford"]
65
>>> big_game_wins["Cal"]
48
>>> big_game_wins["Cal"] += 1
>>> big_game_wins["Cal"]
49
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}

\begin{blocksection}
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> list(big_game_wins.keys())
["Cal", "Stanford"]
>>> list(big_game_wins.values())
[49, 65]

>>> "Cal" in big_game_wins
True
>>> "Tie" in big_game_wins
False
>>> 65 in big_game_wins
False
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}

\begin{blocksection}
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> big_game_wins["Tie"]
KeyError: Tie
>>> big_game_wins["Tie"] = 11
>>> big_game_wins["Tie"]
11
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}

In this approach, instead of detailing all the functions of a dictionary, the emphasis is on teaching through an extended example. We've observed that students often lose interest when presented with extensive material, so it's advisable to guide them through the entire process.

From a technical standpoint, dictionaries are ordered in Python. But your students don't need to know that.
