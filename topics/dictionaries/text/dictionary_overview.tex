\textbf{Dictionaries Introduction:}

Dictionaries are another data structure that store keys and values in pairs. 
They are not unordered, so you cannot iterate over them directly like you would with lists,
but you can access each value of a dictionary with it's key.

Here are some examples

\begin{lstlisting}
    >>> 
\end{lstlisting}
