\question What's the advantage of using a stream over a scheme list?
\begin{solution}[0.5in] 
Lazy evaluation. We only evaluate up to what we need.
\end{solution}

\question What's the maximum size of a stream?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Infinity
\end{solution}

\question What's stored in the car and cdr of a stream? What are their types? 
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
First is a value, rest is another stream encapsulated in a promise. The promise in the cdr of a stream may be forced (evaluated) or unforced (yet to be evaluated)
\end{solution}

\question When is the next element actually calculated?
\begin{solution}[.5in]
Only when it's requested (and hasn't already been calculated)
\end{solution}
