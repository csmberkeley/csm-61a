\question Implement \lstinline$interleave$, which returns a stream that alternates between the values in stream1 and stream2.
Assume that the streams are infinitely long.

\ifprintanswers\else
\begin{lstlisting}

(define (interleave stream1 stream2)
















)
\end{lstlisting}
\fi

\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (interleave stream1 stream2)
    (cons-stream
        (car stream1)
        (interleave stream2 (cdr-stream stream1))
    )
)

Alternate Solution:
(define (interleave stream1 stream2)
    (cons-stream (car stream1)
        (cons-stream (car stream2)
            (interleave (cdr-stream stream1) (cdr-stream stream2))))
)
\end{lstlisting}
