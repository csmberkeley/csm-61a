\question Implement \lstinline$interleave$, which returns a stream that alternates between the values in stream1 and stream2.
Assume that the streams are infinitely long.

\begin{lstlisting}

(define (interleave stream1 stream2)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (interleave stream1 stream2)
    (cons-stream
        (car stream1)
