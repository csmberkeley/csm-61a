\part You and your CS 61A friends are cons.
You cdr'd just studied for the final, but instead you scheme to drive away across a stream in a car during dead week.
Of course, you would like a variety of food to eat on your road trip.

Write an infinite stream that takes in a list of foods and loops back to the
first food in the list when the list is exhausted.

\ifprintanswers\else
\begin{lstlisting}
;Doctests
scm> (define fruit (food-stream '(apple banana orange)))
fruit
scm> (car fruit)
apple
scm> (car (cdr-stream fruit))
banana
scm> (car (cdr-stream (cdr-stream (cdr-stream fruit))))
apple

(define (food-stream foods)
\end{lstlisting}
\fi

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (food-stream foods)
     (cons-stream (car foods)
          (food-stream (append (cdr foods)
               (list (car foods))))))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\part We discover that some of our food is stale! Every other food that we go
through is stale, so put it into a new stale food stream. Assume
\lstinline$is-stale$ starts off as \lstinline$#f$.

cookies
scm> (car cookies)
chocolate

(define (stale-stream foods is-stale)
