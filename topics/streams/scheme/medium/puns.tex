\part You and your CS 61A friends are cons.
You cdr'd just studied for the final, but instead you scheme to drive away across a stream in a car during dead week.
Of course, you would like a variety of food to eat on your road trip.

Write an infinite stream that takes in a list of foods and loops back to the
first food in the list when the list is exhausted.

\ifprintanswers\else
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (food-stream foods)
\end{lstlisting}
\fi

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
  (cons-stream (car foods)
               (food-stream (append (cdr foods)
                                    (list (car foods))))
  )
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\part We discover that some of our food is stale! Every other food that we go
through is stale, so put it into a new stale food stream. Assume
\lstinline$is-stale$ starts off at 0.

\ifprintanswers\else
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (stale-stream foods is-stale)
\end{lstlisting}
\fi

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (stale-stream foods is-stale)
  (cond ((null? foods) nil)
        ((= is-stale 1)
          (cons-stream (car foods)
                       (stale-stream (cdr foods) 0)))
        (else (stale-stream (cdr foods) 1))
  )
)
