To simplify the doctests for these problems, we will use the following helper functions. \lstinline{make_stream} constructs a finite stream with elements identical to the list we call it on. \lstinline{print_stream} returns a list with elements identical to the finite stream we call it on.

\textbf{Important Note:} You may \underline{not} use these functions in any of your solutions. To reiterate, these are purely to save space in the doctests.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (make-stream lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        nil
        (cons-stream (car lst) (make-stream (cdr lst))))
)

(define (print-stream s)
    (if (null? s)
        nil
        (cons (car s) (print-stream (cdr-stream s))))
)
\end{lstlisting}
