\question What's the difference between a \emph{primitive expression} and a \emph{call expression}?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
A primitive expression directly evaluates to a \emph{value}, like a number, string, or \texttt{None} while call expressions accept arguments and perform some computations \emph{before evaluating to a value}.
\end{solution}
