    \textbf{Teaching Tips}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Some students might have done swaps in other languages, but make sure to make the distiction as to why \lstinline{funny, sad = sad, funny} works in Python
        \item evaluate the functions on the RHS first, then assign to variables on the LHS
        \item Make sure that the students understand how Python looks for a value of a variable, from local (to parent(s)) to global
      \end{itemize}
