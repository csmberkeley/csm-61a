\question Why does Python behave this way?

\begin{solution}[1in]
Each value in Python has a \emph{type}. When we perform ``addition'', Python looks at the \emph{type} of each value to figure out what to do. When both values are \emph{numbers}, then we compute the sum of the numbers. When both values are \emph{strings}, then we join the strings. However, Python doesn't know how to add numbers to strings so it says, \texttt{TypeError}.
\end{solution}
