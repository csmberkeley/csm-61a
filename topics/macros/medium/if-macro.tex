\question Implement \texttt{if-macro}, which behaves similarly to the \texttt{if} special form in Scheme
but has some additional properties. Here's how the \texttt{if-macro} is called:
\newline
\texttt{if <cond1> <expr1> elif <cond2> <expr2> else <expr3>}
\newline
If cond1 evaluates to a truth-y value, expr1 is evaluated and returned. Otherwise, if cond2 evaluates
to a truth-y value, expr2 is evaluated and returned. If neither condition is true, expr3 is evaluted and returned.

\begin{lstlisting}
;Doctests
scm> (if-macro (= 1 0) 1 elif (= 1 1) 2 else 3)
2
scm> (if-macro (= 1 1) 1 elif (= 2 2) 2 else 3)
1
scm> (if-macro (= 1 0) (/ 1 0) elif (= 2 0) (/ 1 0) else 3)
3

(define-macro (if-macro cond1 expr1 elif cond2 expr2 else expr3)













)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
(define-macro (if-macro cond1 expr1 elif cond2 expr2 else expr3)
    (list 'cond (list cond1 expr1)
             (list cond2 expr2)
             (list 'else expr3)))
\end{lstlisting}
Alternate solution with nested ifs:
\begin{lstlisting}
(define-macro (if-macro cond1 expr1 elif cond2 expr2 else expr3)
    (list 'if cond1 expr1 (list 'if cond2 expr2 expr3)))
\end{lstlisting}
Alternate solution with quasiquoting:
\begin{lstlisting}
(define-macro (if-macro cond1 expr1 elif cond2 expr2 else expr3)
    `(cond (,cond1 ,expr1)
             (,cond2 ,expr2)
             (else ,expr3)))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\textbf{Teaching Tips}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item As with other macro problems, we need to return a list that, when evaluated, behaves as desired
    \item For the \lstinline{if-macro}, this means we need to transform the inputs into expressions that evaluate according to the \lstinline{if} / \lstinline{elif} / \lstinline{else} structure
    \item We have two methods of doing this in scheme: nested \lstinline{if} statements or a \lstinline{cond} statement
    \item Because \lstinline{cond} statements tend to be easier to read, we will take this
    approach
    \item Since we need to return a list to be evaluated, this means we should return a list that matches a \lstinline{cond} expression: the first element will be \lstinline{'cond}, the second the first condition-case pair, the third element the next pair, and so on
   \item Because we do not want \lstinline{cond} or \lstinline{else} to be evaluated, we quote these two expressions
   \item An alternate solution is to use quasiquoting
   Instead of quoting \lstinline{else} and \lstinline{cond}, we can instead quasiquote the value we create and unquote all but those two expressions

\question Could we have implemented \texttt{if-macro} using a function instead of a macro? Why or why not?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Without using macros, the inputs would be evaluated when we evaluated the function call. This is problematic for two reasons:
\newline
First, we only want to evaluate the expressions under certain conditions. If cond1 was false, we would not want to evaluate expr1. This might lead to errors!
\newline
Secondly, some of the inputs to the call would be names which have no binding in the global frame. Elif, for example, is not supposed to be interpreted as a name
but rather as a symbol. This would cause our code to error if we ran it as is!
\newline
However, it is also possible to recreate a similar behavior to macros with a function by delaying the final evaluation. This makes it considerably more complicated to produce
the desired behavior, since all inputs would have to be quoted and \texttt{eval} would have to be manually called on the result:
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (if-macro-without-macro cond1 expr1 elif cond2 expr2 else expr3)
  (list 'cond (list cond1 expr1)
           (list cond2 expr2)
           (list 'else expr3))
)

(eval (if-macro-without-macro '(= 1 0) '(/ 1 0) 'elif '(= 2 0) '(/ 1 0) 'else '3))
\end{lstlisting}

\end{solution}
