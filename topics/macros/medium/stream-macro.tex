\question Challenge: You decide you want to try implementing streams on your own. You know that you need some way 
to enforce lazy evaluation, so you come up with the following strategy:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item To create the stream, you'll use a macro, \texttt{cons-stream-macro} which takes in two argument and returns a 
pair where the first element is the first argument and the second element is the second argument put inside a parameter-less
lambda function.
\item To access the second element of the stream, you'll create a procedure, \texttt{cdr-stream-macro} which evaluates the
function you put in the \texttt{cdr} of the stream in \texttt{cons-stream-macro}. It also replaces the second element of the stream
with a new paramater-less lambda function which returns the value you just computed.
\end{enumerate}
