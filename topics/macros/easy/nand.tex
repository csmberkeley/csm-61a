\begin{blocksection}
\question NAND (not and) is a logical operation that returns false if all of its operands are true, and true otherwise. That is, it returns the opposite of AND. Implement the \lstinline{nand} macro procedure below, which takes in a list of expressions and returns the NAND of their values. Similar to \lstinline{and}, \lstinline{nand} should short circuit and return true as soon as it encounters a false operand, evaluating from left to right. 

Hint: You may use \lstinline{meta-apply} in your implementation. 

\begin{lstlisting}
;Doctests
scm> (nand (#t #t #t #t #t #t))
#f
scm> (nand (#t #f #t))
#t
scm> (nand (#f (/ 1 0)))
#t
(define-macro (nand operands))
