\textbf{Lists Introduction:}

Lists are type of sequence, which means they are an ordered collection of values that has both length and the ability to select elements. 

\begin{lstlisting} 
>>> lst = [1, False, [2, 3], 4] # a list can contain anything
>>> len(lst) 	
4
>>> lst[0] 	
1
>>> lst[4] 	# Indices of a list only go up to the len(lst)
Error: list index out of range
\end{lstlisting}

We can iterate over lists using their index, or iterate of elements directly

\begin{lstlisting}
for index in range(len(lst)):
	# do things
for item in lst:
	# do things
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{List comprehensions} are a useful way to iterate over lists when your desired result is a list.
\begin{lstlisting}
new_list2 = [<expression> for <element> in <sequence> if <condition>]
\end{lstlisting}

We can use \textbf{list splicing} to create a copy of a certain portion or all of a list 

\begin{lstlisting}
new_list = lst[<starting index>:<ending index>]
\end{lstlisting}

	\textbf{Teaching Tips}
	\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Box and Pointer Diagrams}: make sure students know how to draw them. Try explaining lists using box and pointer diagrams from the start so they can visualize how they interact with lists
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Be very careful with showing and explaining how pointers work. You can treat pointers as a distinct object in the list (e.g. this element of the list is a pointer), so that they have a solid foundation once we get to mutation (like how a shallow copy copies what’s in the box as is, which would be just the pointer)
				\item Pay attention to where students draw their pointers (e.g. if a pointer points to another list, make sure it points to the beginning of the list)
			\end{itemize}
			\item For students that have not had experience with lists + arrays, might help to write up some common operations and keep it on one part of the board. Here are some tricky points:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Zero indexing. Might help to draw the indices in with the first couple of box and pointer diagrams
				\item List slicing: what elements are included or not included?
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Inclusive start, exclusive end
					\item Probably don’t need to get into every little thing (like negative indices, skipping elements, etc.) 
				\end{itemize}
				\item Deep copy vs Shallow copy: When you copy a nested list, copy pointers to the nested list (a shallow copy)  rather than make a new copy of the nested list (a deep copy).
				\item Creation vs. mutation
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Good to make a chart of all the operations that mutate versus make a new list
					\item make sure to explain that lst + lst creates a new list, and doesn’t change the original one
					\item for example, lst +\= \[3\] is NOT the same as lst \= lst + \[3\]
					the first one mutates lst and is equivalent to .extend(\[3\]), while the second one creates a new list
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
