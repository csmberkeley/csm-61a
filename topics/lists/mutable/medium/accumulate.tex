\question Given some list \texttt{lst}, possibly a deep list, mutate \texttt{lst} to have the accumulated sum of all elements so far in the list. If there is a nested list, mutate it to similarly reflect the accumulated sum of all elements so far in the nested list. Return the total sum of the original \texttt{lst}.

\emph{Hint:} The \lstinline$isinstance$ function returns True for \lstinline$isinstance(l, list)$ if \texttt{l} is a list and False otherwise.

\textbf{Teaching Tips}

\begin{itemize}
\item To keep track of the accumulated sum we need to create a variable in the function that keeps track of the overall sum of the list so we can mutate it.
\item Make sure to emphasize the distinction between \lstinline{for item in lst} and \lstinline{for i in range(len(lst))}. (We need \lstinline{i} in order to mutate the list.)
\item Why do we need a conditional in the for loop? What do we do when we have a nested list?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Integers:  For integers we just add the value to the ongoing sum and then mutate the current index of the list to be the cumulative sum
\item Lists: We need to break down the list and get the values, both so that we can update them and so that we can add it into our sum.  However, we donâ€™t know how many levels of nesting we have in our list
\begin{itemize} 
\item We could have something like \lstinline{[1, [2, [3]]]}, so we need a function that will sum up the 
values from a potentially nested list.  Do we have a function that does this?
\item \textbf{Emphasize the recursive leap of faith when calling accumulate on the inner list}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item We return the accumulated sum of the list which includes all values, even the nested ones because of the recursive call. 
\end{itemize}
