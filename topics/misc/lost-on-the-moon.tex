Your spaceship has just crashed on the moon. You were scheduled to rendezvous
with a mother ship 200 miles away on the lighted surface of the moon, but the
rough landing has ruined your ship and destroyed all the equipment on board
except for the 15 items listed below.

Your crew's survival depends on reaching the mother ship, so you must choose
the most critical items available for the 200-mile trip. Rank the 15 items in
terms of their importance for survival. (1: most important, 15: least
important.)

\begin{solution}
Error points are the absolute difference between your rankings and
NASA's (disregard plus or minus signs).
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 - 25: excellent
    \item 26 - 32: good
    \item 33 - 55: fair
    \item 56 - 70: oops
    \item 71 - 112: oh well
