\question Create a \lstinline$mod_seven$ table that has two columns, a number from 0 to 100 and then its value mod 7.

\emph{Hint:} You can create a table first with all of the initial data you will build from, and then build the \lstinline$mod_seven$ table.

\begin{solution}[2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
with
    base(n) as (
        select 0 union
        select n + 1 from base where n + 1 < 7
    ),
    mod_seven (n, value) as (
        select n, n from base union
        select n + 7, value from mod_seven where n + 7 <= 100
    )
select * from mod_seven;

-- ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION WITH MODULO OPERATOR
with
    mod_seven (n, value) as (
        select 0, 0 union
        select n+1, (n + 1) % 7 from mod_seven where n < 100
     )
select * from mod_seven;

-- ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION WITH ONE TABLE
with
    mod_seven (n, value) as (
        select 0, 0 union
        select 1, 1 union
        select 2, 2 union
        select 3, 3 union
        select 4, 4 union
        select 5, 5 union
        select 6, 6 union
        select n + 7, value from mod_seven where n + 7 <= 100
    )
select * from mod_seven;
