\question Write a query that lists all the pairs of mentors who like the same language. (How can we make sure to remove duplicates?)

\begin{lstlisting}
Catherine|Jamie
Ethan|Kenny
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
select m1.name, m2.name
    from mentors as m1, mentors as m2
    where m1.language = m2.language and m1.name < m2.name;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}

\begin{guide}
\begin{blocksection}
Some key points to explain:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why do we need to select from the same table twice? (To get pairs of mentors)
	\item Why do we need to alias here? Can we do it without aliasing? (No, we need aliasing because it is the same table)
	\item Why do we need m1.name < m2.name ? Can we use != instead or leave that out completely?
\end{itemize}
