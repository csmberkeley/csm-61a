After more than 100 years of operation, the Ringling Bros. circus is closing.  A victory for animal rights advocates, the circus' closure poses a challenge for the zoologists tasked with moving the circus' animals to more suitable habitats.
 
The zoologists must first take the animals in a freight elevator with a weight limit of 2000.  In order to speed up the process, the zoologists prefer to take groups of animals of the same species in the elevator, rather than one animal at a time.  

Assume the zoologists will only put all of the animals of a particular species in the elevator, or take animals of that particular species one at a time.

You have access to the table \lstinline$animals$, with columns containing the animals' names, weights, and species.
