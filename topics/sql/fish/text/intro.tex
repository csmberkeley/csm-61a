The 61A mentors want to start a fish hatchery, and they need your help to analyze the data they've collected for the fish populations! Also, running a hatchery is expensive -- they'd like to make some money on the side by selling some seafood (only older fish of course) to make delicious sushi.

The following table contains a subset of the data that has been collected. The SQL column names are listed in brackets. Note: we must be able to extend your queries to larger tables! (So don't hard-code your answers!)
