CS 61A wants to start a fish hatchery, and we need your help to analyze the data we've collected for the fish populations! Running a hatchery is expensive -- we'd like to make some money on the side by selling some seafood (only older fish of course) to make delicious sushi.

The table \lstinline$fish$ contains a subset of the data that has been collected. The SQL column names are listed in brackets.
