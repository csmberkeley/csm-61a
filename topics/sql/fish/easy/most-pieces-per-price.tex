\part Profit is good, but more profit is better. Write a query to select the species that yields the greatest number of pieces for each price point. For example, if ``Trout'' and ``Catfish'' both cost 100 dollars/piece, you should output the species that has the greater number of pieces. Your output should include the species, price, and number of pieces per fish.

\begin{solution}[0.7in]
\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT species, price, MAX(pieces) 
FROM fish 
GROUP BY price;
\end{lstlisting}
