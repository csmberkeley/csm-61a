\question Business is good, but a bunch of competition has sprung up! Through some cunning corporate espionage, we have determined that one such competitor plans to open shop with the following rates:

Write a query that returns, for each species, the difference between our hatchery's revenue versus the competitor's revenue for one whole fish. For example, the table should contain the following row:

\begin{lstlisting}
Salmon | 60
\end{lstlisting}

Because we make 30 pieces at \$4 a piece for \$120, whereas the competitor will make 30 pieces at \$2 a piece for \$60. Finally, the difference is 60. Remember to do this for every species!

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
select fish.species, (fish.price - competitor.price) * pieces
    from fish, competitor
    where fish.species = competitor.species;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
