\question Business is good, but a bunch of competition has sprung up! Through some cunning corporate espionage, we have determined one such competitor's selling prices.

Write a query that returns, for each species, the difference between our hatchery's revenue versus the competitor's revenue for one whole fish. 

This is because we make 30 pieces at \$4 a piece for \$120, whereas the competitor will make 30 pieces at \$2 a piece for \$60. Therefore, the difference is 60.

\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
select fish.species, (fish.price - competitor.price) * pieces
    from fish, competitor
    where fish.species = competitor.species;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
