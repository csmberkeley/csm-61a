For the following two questions, you have access to two tables.

\textbf{Grades}, which contains three columns: \lstinline{day}, \lstinline{class}, and \lstinline{score}. Each row represents the \lstinline{score} you got on a midterm for some \lstinline{class} that you took on some \lstinline{day}.

\textbf{Outfits}, which contains two columns: \lstinline{day} and \lstinline{color}. Each row represents the \lstinline{color} of the shirt you wore on some \lstinline{day}. Assume you have a row for each possible day.
