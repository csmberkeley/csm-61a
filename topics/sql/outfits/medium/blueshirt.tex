You want to find out how you did on the midterms to which you wore your blue shirt to. So write a query which is going to yield a table where there is a row for each day you wore a blue shirt to a midterm (or multiple midterms) and then sum of midterm scores for that day. 

\begin{solution}[0.7in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    SELECT grades.day, sum(score) 
    FROM grades, outfits 
    WHERE outfits.color = "blue" and outfits.day = grades.day 
    GROUP BY grades.day;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
