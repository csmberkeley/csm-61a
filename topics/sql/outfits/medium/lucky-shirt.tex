\question 
Instead of actually studying for your finals, you decide it would be the best use of your time to determine what your "lucky shirt" is. Suppose you're pretty happy with your exam scores this semester, so you define your lucky shirt as the shirt you wore to the most exams.

Write a query that will output the color of your lucky shirt and how many times you wore it.

\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
select color, count(g.day) as cnt
    from outfits as o, grades as g
    where o.day = g.day 
    group by color
    order by cnt desc 
    limit 1;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
