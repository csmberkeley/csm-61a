\question 
Instead of actually studing for your finals, you decide it would be the best use of your time to determine what your "lucky shirt" is for each class. Suppose you define your lucky shirt as the shirt you wore to the midterm you did best on.

Write a query that will output each class and the color shirt you wore to the midterm that you scored the most points on for that class. Also output the score you got on that midterm.

\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
select class, color, max(score)
    from colors as c, grades as g
    where c.day = g.day group by class;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
