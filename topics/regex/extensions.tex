\question We are given a space-separated string of filenames with their extensions. Return all the file extensions.
Assume that filenames and extensions can only have word characters, including the . character, and no spaces in them; if a filename has no extension or an extension no filename,
ignore it. In addition, filenames are required to start with a word character, not a period.

\textbf{Teaching Tips}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clarify the use of \lstinline$'+'$ over \lstinline$'*'$ to match at least one word character - in particular, \lstinline$'*'$ can also match the absence of the preceding character / group.
        \item The second example is a good demonstration of the greedy nature of regex. Explain how the regex disregards ".abc" as a file extension and matches all the way to ".txt".
        \item As with other regex problems, it is helfpul to visually match the components of the regex to the parts of an example string that they match. With the last doctest, highlight what portions are missing that prevent ".file" and "my\_diary" from being matched.
