                \item How can we find the edge of a word? (\lstinline{\b} matches a word boundary)
                \item How can we make sure that the word \textit{ends} with "ing"? (put \lstinline{ing} right before \lstinline{\b})
                \item How can we avoid matching "ing"? (use the \lstinline{+} quantifier to ensure that there is at least one character before "ing")
