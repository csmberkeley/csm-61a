Write a generator function \lstinline{num_elems} that takes in a possibly nested list of numbers \lstinline{lst} and yields the number of elements in each nested list before finally yielding the total number of elements (including the elements of nested lists) in \lstinline{lst}. For a nested list, yield the size of the inner list before the outer, and if you have multiple nested lists, yield their sizes from left to right.

\begin{lstlisting}
def num_elems(lst):
    """
    >>> list(num_elems([3, 3, 2, 1]))
    [4]
    >>> list(num_elems([1, 3, 5, [1, [3, 5, [5, 7]]]]))
    [2, 4, 5, 8]
    """

    count = _______________

    for ___________________________:

        if ________________________:

            for _________________________________:

                yield ___________________________

            _______________________________
        else:

            _______________________________

    yield ___________________________
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
def num_elems(lst):
    count = 0
    for elem in lst:
        if type(elem) is list:
            for c in num_elems(elem):
                yield c
            count += c
        else:
            count += 1
    yield count
\end{lstlisting}

\lstinline{count} refers to the number of elements in the current list \lstinline{lst} (including the number of elements inside any nested list). Determine the value of \lstinline{count} by looping through each element of the current list \lstinline{lst}. If we have an element \lstinline{elem} which is of type \lstinline{list}, we want to yield the number of elements in each nested list of \lstinline{elem} before finally yielding the total number of elements in \lstinline{elem}. We can do this with a recursive call to \lstinline{num_elems}. Thus, we yield all the values that need to be yielded using the inner for loop. The last number yielded by this inner loop is the total number of elements in \lstinline{elem}, which we want to increase \lstinline{count} by. Otherwise, if \lstinline{elem} is not a list, then we can simply increase \lstinline{count} by 1. Finally, yield the total count of the list.
