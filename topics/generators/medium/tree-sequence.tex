\question Define \lstinline$tree_sequence$, a generator that iterates through a tree by first yielding the root value and then yielding the values from each branch.

\begin{lstlisting}
def tree_sequence(t):
    """
    >>> t = tree(1, [tree(2, [tree(5)]), tree(3, [tree(4)])])
    >>> print(list(tree_sequence(t)))
    [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]
    """
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
	yield label(t)
	for branch in branches(t):
		for value in tree_sequence(branch):
			yield value
\end{lstlisting}
Alternate solution:
\begin{lstlisting}
        yield label(t)
	for branch in branches(t):
		yield from tree_sequence(branch)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
