\question Define \lstinline$tree_sequence$, a generator that iterates through a tree by first yielding the root value and then yielding each branch.

\begin{lstlisting}
def tree_sequence(t):
    """
    >>> t = Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(5)]), Tree(3, [Tree(4)])])
    >>> print(list(tree_sequence(t)))
    [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]
    """

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
	yield t.entry
	for branch in t.branches:
		for value in tree_sequence(branch):
