An order of growth (OOG) characterizes the runtime \textbf{efficiency} of a program as its input becomes extremely large. Common runtimes, in increasing order of time, are: constant, logarithmic, linear, quadratic, and exponential.

\textbf{Examples:}

Constant time means that no matter the size of the input, the runtime of your program is consistent. In the function \lstinline{f} below, no matter what you pass in for \lstinline{n}, the runtime is the same. \\
\begin{lstlisting}
def f(n):
   return 1 + 2
\end{lstlisting}
A common example of a linear OOG involves a single for/while loop. In the example below, as \lstinline{n} gets larger, the amount of time to run the function grows proportionally. \\
\begin{lstlisting}
def f(n):
   while n > 0:
      print(n)
      n -= 1
\end{lstlisting}
An example of a quadratic runtime involves nested for loops. If you increment the value of \lstinline{n} by only 1, an additional \lstinline{n} amount of work is being done, since the inner for loop will run one more time. This means that the runtime is proportional to \lstinline{n}$^{2}$. \\
\begin{lstlisting}
def f(n):
   for i in range(n):
      for j in range(n):
         print(i*j)
\end{lstlisting}
