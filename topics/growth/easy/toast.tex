    while i < n:
        stack += pancake(n)

\begin{solution}
$O(n \cdot 2^n)$. There are two loops: the first runs $n$ times with each iteration taking $\Theta(2^n)$ time for a total of $\Theta(n \cdot 2^n)$. The second loop runs $n$ times with each iteration taking constant time for a total of $\Theta(n)$. When computing the order of growth, however, we focus on the dominating term -- in this case, $\Theta(n \cdot 2^n + n) \in \Theta(n \cdot 2^n)$.
