\question What is the order of growth for \lstinline{belgian_waffle}? \\
\begin{lstlisting}
def belgian_waffle(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += 1
        n = n // 2
    return total
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
Logarithmic. Notice that with each pass through the while loop, the value of \lstinline{n} is halved. Since we are halving till 0, this would be a logarithmic runtime.
\end{solution}

    \textbf{Teaching Tips}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Try to draw out a diagram for this problem:
       \begin{itemize}
            \item We can tally up how many times the "while" loop runs. 
            \item For belgian\_waffle(4):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Before running while loop: n = 4, total = 0. Runs = 0.
                \item During first iteration: n = 3, total = 1. Runs = 1.
                \item During second iteration: n = 2, total = 2. Runs = 2.
                \item During third iteration: n = 1, total = 3. Runs = 3.
                \item During fourth iteration: n = 0, total = 4. Runs = 4.
            \end{itemize}
