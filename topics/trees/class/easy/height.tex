\question Implement \lstinline$height$ which takes in a 
tree and returns the height of that tree. Recall that the
height of a tree is defined as the depth of the lowest leaf,
where the depth of the top node of the tree is 0.

\begin{lstlisting}
def tree_sum(t):
    """
    >>> t = Tree(1, [Tree(4), Tree(2, [Tree(3)])])
    >>> height(t)
    2
    """
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    if t.is_leaf():
        return 0
    return 1 + max([height(b) for b in t.branches])
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
