\question DoubleTree has hired you to architect one of their hotel expansions!
As you might expect, their floor plan can be modeled as a tree and the expansion
plan requires doubling each node (the patented double tree floor plan). Shown to
the right are what some sample expansions look like before and after executing
the floor plan expansion.

Complete the implementation for \lstinline$double_tree$.

\begin{lstlisting}
def double_tree(t):
    """
    Given a tree, return a new tree where entries appear
    twice.
    >>> double_tree(Tree(1))
    Tree(1, [Tree(1)])
    >>> double_tree(Tree(1, [Tree(2), Tree(3)]))
    Tree(1, [Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(2)]),
                      Tree(3, [Tree(3)])
                     ])
            ])
    """
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    if t.is_leaf():
        return Tree(t.root, [Tree(t.root)])
    else:
        branches = [double_tree(c) for c in t.branches]
        return Tree(t.root, [Tree(t.root, branches)])
\end{lstlisting}
