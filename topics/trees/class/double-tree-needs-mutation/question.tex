\question DoubleTree hired you to architect one of their hotel expansions!  As
you might expect, their floor plan can be modeled as a tree and the expansion
plan requires doubling each node (the patented double tree floor plan). Here's
what some sample expansions look like:\\\\
\begin{tabular}{c c}
\textbf{Before} & \textbf{After}\\
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick, scale=1.5, transform shape]
    \node [circle, draw] (z){$1$}
        child {node [circle, draw] (a) {$2$}}
        child {node [circle, draw] (b) {$3$}}
        ;
\end{tikzpicture}
&
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick, scale=1.0, transform shape]
    \node [circle, draw] (z){$1$}
        child {node [circle, draw] (a) {$1$}
            child {node [circle, draw] (b) {$2$}
                child {node [circle, draw] (d) {$2$}}
            }
            child {node [circle, draw] (c) {$3$}
                child {node [circle, draw] (e) {$3$}}
            }
        }
        ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{tabular}

Fill in the implementation for \texttt{double\char`_tree}.
