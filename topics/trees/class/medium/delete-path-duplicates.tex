Define \texttt{delete\_path\_duplicates}, which takes in \texttt{t}, a tree
with non-negative labels. If there are any duplicate labels on any path 
from root to leaf, the function should mutate the label of the occurrences
deeper in the tree (i.e. farther from the root) to be the value \texttt{-1}.

\begin{lstlisting}
def delete_path_duplicates(t):
   """
   >>> t = Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(1), Tree(1)])])
   >>> delete_path_duplicates(t)
   >>> t
   Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(-1), Tree(-1)])])
   >>> t2 = Tree(1, [Tree(2), Tree(2, [Tree(2, [Tree(1)])])])
   >>> delete_path_duplicates(t2)
   >>> t2
   Tree(1, [Tree(2), Tree(2, [Tree(-1, [Tree(-1)])])])
   """
