\question A character tree is a tree where the characters along a path of the tree form a word (as defined in the English dictionary). A path through a tree is a list of adjacent node values that starts from any node and ends with a leaf value. 

Imagine you're playing a version of Scrabble and you really want to win. Implement \texttt{scrabble\char`_tree} which takes in a character tree. The function will then find all words in the character tree and return the word with the highest value. You may use the pre-defined functions \texttt{is\char`_word(word)} and \texttt{score(word)}. You can assume that all characters in the character tree are lower cased.

The function \texttt{is\char`_word(word)} returns True if word is a valid dictionary word and False otherwise. Additionally, you are given a function \texttt{score(word)}, which returns the score of word in a game of Scrabble. You do not need to worry about how these functions are implemented.

\textbf{Note}: If all characters have a weight of 1, then this problem is the same as finding the longest string of the character tree.

\begin{parts}
\item First, implement the function \texttt{word\char`_exists}, which takes in a word \texttt{word} and a character tree \texttt{t}. The function will return \texttt{True} if characters along a path from the root of \texttt{t} to a leaf spells \texttt{word}. Otherwise, it returns \texttt{False}.

\begin{lstlisting}
def word_exists(word, t):
    if len(word) == 1:
        return _____________________________________
    elif ____________________:
        return False
    return _____(_____________________________________________)

\end{lstlisting}

\item Now, implement the function \texttt{scrabble\char`_tree}. You may use the function you defined in part a, as well as the provided functions \texttt{is\char`_word(word)} and \texttt{score}. You may also want to use the built-in Python function \texttt{filter}.

The function \texttt{filter} takes in a single argument function as its first parameter and a sequence as its second parameter. The function will then test which elements of the sequence is \texttt{True} using the provided function.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst))
>>> evens
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
\end{lstlisting}

Note: We have to call list on the output of filter because filter returns an object (which will be covered in a later part of this course).
