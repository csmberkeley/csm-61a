\textbf{What are trees?}

A tree has a root label and a sequence of branches. Each branch of a tree is a tree. A tree with no branches is called a leaf. Any tree contained within a tree is called a sub-tree of that tree (such as a branch of a branch). The root of each sub-tree of a tree is called a node in that tree. 
Trees are a recursive data abstraction, since trees have branches that are trees themselves

Because of this, it often makes sense to solve tree problems using recursion:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Base case is often when we reach a leaf node
	\item Recursive case is often when we still need to recurse down, e.g. we haven’t hit a leaf yet. Recursive calls need to break the problem into smaller parts, which for trees often means passing in each branch as an input.
\end{enumerate}

When trying to understand and solve tree problems, it is helpful to draw out the tree.

	\textbf{Teaching Tips}
	\begin{enumerate}
			\item Common Misconceptions:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Students often have trouble with the idea that branches is a list of trees
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Clearly define what is a tree
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Try using the tree functions to build up different trees (like build a tree with no branches, build a tree with one branch etc.)
					\end{itemize}
					\item Write out all the functions on the board and clearly define what type of thing is returned and what types of things are inputted.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Data abstraction and Trees
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Because they have not learned objects yet, trees are represented as lists.
					\item Although t[0] returns the label from the tree, students should be using label(t). This is because t is not a list, it is a tree which is an ADT!
					\begin{itemize}
						\item It’s important to explain why branches(t)[0] for example is not violating an abstraction barrier because branches returns a list of trees regardless of how the tree is implemented.
					\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			\item The objectives for students are to: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Draw trees as graphical representations given Python code  
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Mention to students that empty branches [] is a default argument so it doesn’t have to be written out, i.e. tree(5) is the same as tree(5, [])
					\item Emphasize variable types
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Emphasize that branches is a function that returns a list of trees. Drawing a box and pointer diagram might be a helpful way to explain this
						\item Label values are numbers
					\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
				\item Construct Python code given a graphical representation of a tree 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Make it clear which branches belong to which label
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Use indenting to make this clear or use different colored markers
					\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			\item Refer to functions (not using a Tree class)
