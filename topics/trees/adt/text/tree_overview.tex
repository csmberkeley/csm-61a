\textbf{What are trees?}

A tree has a root label and a sequence of branches. Each branch of a tree is a tree. A tree with no branches is called a leaf. Any tree contained within a tree is called a sub-tree of that tree (such as a branch of a branch). The root of each sub-tree of a tree is called a node in that tree.
Trees are a recursive data abstraction, since trees have branches that are trees themselves.

Because of this, it often makes sense to solve tree problems using recursion:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Base case is often when we reach a leaf node
	\item Recursive case is often when we still need to recurse down, e.g. we haven’t hit a leaf yet. Recursive calls need to break the problem into smaller parts, which for trees often means passing in each branch as an input.
\end{enumerate}

When trying to understand and solve tree problems, it is helpful to draw out the tree.

	\textbf{Teaching Tips}
	\begin{itemize}
			\item Common Misconceptions:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Students often have trouble with the idea that branches is a list of trees. Try to be specific when explaining, focusing on types. (Branches are lists, saving trees in them.)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Try using the tree functions to build up different trees.
					\item Write out all the functions on the board and clearly define the types of the output and input.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Data Abstraction and Trees
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Although \lstinline{t[0]} returns the label from the tree, students should be using \lstinline{label(t)}. This is because \lstinline{t} is not a list, it is a tree which is a data abstraction!
					\item It’s important to explain why indexing branches (e.g. \lstinline{branches(t)[0]}) doesn't violate an abstraction barrier (since branches returns a list of trees).
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			\item The objectives for students are to:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Draw trees as graphical representations given Python code
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Mention to students that empty branches \lstinline{[]} is the default argument, so \lstinline{tree(5)} is the same as \lstinline{tree(5, [])}.
					\item Emphasize variable types.
					\item It may be helpful to mark pairs of parentheses to help in understand the nesting relationships.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Branches is a function that returns a list of trees.
						\item Label values are numbers.
					\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
				\item Construct Python code given a graphical representation of a tree
			\end{itemize}
