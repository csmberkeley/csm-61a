\question Let \texttt{t} be the tree depicted above. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
If the expressions evaluates to a tree, format your answer as
\lstinline{tree(... , ...)}. 
(Note that the Python interpreter wouldn't display trees like this. This is just so you think about trees as an ADT instead of worrying about their implementation.)

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> label(t)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[.25in]
4
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> branches(t)[1]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[.25in]
\begin{lstlisting}
tree(2, [tree(2), tree(1)])
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> branches(branches(t)[1])[1]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[.25in]
\begin{lstlisting}
tree(1)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
