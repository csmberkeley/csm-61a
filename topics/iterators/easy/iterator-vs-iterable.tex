\question What is difference between an iterator and an iterable?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Iterator: Mutable object that tracks a position in a sequence, advancing on each call to \lstinline$next$

Iterable: Represents a sequence and returns a new iterator on each call to \lstinline$iter$

To use in an English sentence:
Lists are "iterable". To go through a list, you make an object called an "iterator" to scan through the list.
\end{solution}
