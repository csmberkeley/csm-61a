\question What is wrong with the following function? How can we fix it?

\begin{lstlisting}
def factorial(n):
    return n * factorial(n)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
There is no base case and the recursive call is made on the same \lstinline{n}.

\begin{lstlisting}
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{questionmeta}
    This is a good opportunity to emphasize to your students that the return type of the base case should match the return type of the function (e.g., if the function is expected to return an integer, the base case must also return an integer).
