\question Here is a Python function that computes the \lstinline$n$th Fibonnacci number. What's the domain and range of this function? Identify the three parts of this recursive program.

\begin{lstlisting}
def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
The domain is in the integers and the range is in the integers. There are two
base cases for checking if \lstinline$n == 0$ or if \lstinline$n == 1$. There
is one recursive case that makes two recursive calls, reducing the problem down
to \lstinline$fib(n - 1)$ and \lstinline$fib(n - 2)$, respectively.
\end{solution}
