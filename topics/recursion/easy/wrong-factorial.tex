\question What is wrong with the following function? How can we fix it?

\begin{lstlisting}
def factorial(n):
    return n * factorial(n)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
There is no base case and the recursive call is made on the same \lstinline{n}.

\begin{lstlisting}
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{questionmeta}
    Great time to remind your students that the the base case will always return
     the same type as the function (i.e. if the function returns an int, the base case will have to return an int)
