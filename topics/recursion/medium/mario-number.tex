\question Mario needs to jump over a series of Piranha plants, represented as a

one is easier to check?}

You can think about this tree recursion problem as testing out all of the possible ways Mario can traverse the level, and adding 1 every time you find a possible traversal.

Here it doesn’t matter whether Mario goes left to right or right to left; either way we’ll end up with the same number of ways to traverse the \lstinline{level}. In that case, we can simply choose for Mario to start from the right, then we can process the level like we process other numbers in digit-parsing related questions by using floor div (\lstinline{//}) and modulo (\lstinline{%})

At every time step, Mario can either take one or two steps, and these would take form in two corresponding recursive calls. A single floor division (\lstinline{//}) of \lstinline{level} by 10 means taking one step at this point in the \lstinline{level} (if we took a step, then the entire \lstinline{level} would be left except for the last number), while two floor divisions by 10 (or equivalently one floor division by 100) corresponds to a jump at this point in the \lstinline{level} (if we took a jump, then the entire \lstinline{level} would be left except for the last two numbers).

To think of the base cases, you can consider the two ways that Mario ends his journey. The first, corresponding to \lstinline{level == 1}, means that Mario has successfully reached the end of the level. You can \lstinline{return 1} here, because this means you’ve found one additional path to the end. The second, corresponding to \lstinline{level % 10 == 0}, means that Mario has landed on a Piranha plant. This returns 0 because it’s a failed traversal of the \lstinline{level}, so you don’t want to add anything to your result. 

In tree recursion, you need to find a way to combine separate recursive calls. In this case, because \lstinline{mario_number} returns an integer and the base cases are integers and you’re trying to count the total number of ways of traversal, it makes sense to add your recursive calls.
