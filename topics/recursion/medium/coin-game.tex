\question \texttt{n} is a sequence of coins each with a value represented as an integer. (That is, each digit of \texttt{n} is a coin)

There are two players who alternate turns each picking either the last coin (the rightmost digit) or both the last and the second to last coin in an attempt to get the largest score in the end. 

The purpose of this function is to return the highest score the first player (\texttt{player = True}) can get in this game if the other player (\texttt{player = False}) plays optimally.


\begin{lstlisting}
def coin_game(n, player = True):

    if ________ and _________:
		
   	    return n
				
    elif _________ and ___________:
		
        return 0
				
    elif ____________:
				
            last = ______________________________
						
            second_to_last = (n % 100 - last) // 10
						
            return max(_________________, __________________)
						
    else:
		
        return min(__________________, ___________________)
