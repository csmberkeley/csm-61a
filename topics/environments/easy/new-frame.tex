\question When do we make a new frame in an environment diagram?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
We make a new frame in an environment diagram when calling a user-defined function, or when we are applying the operator to the operand(s). This occurs after both the operator and operand(s) are evaluated.

New frames are \textit{not} created when a function is defined, only when it is called. 
\end{solution}

\begin{questionmeta}
    This is meant to be a very quick warm-up question with the goals of 1) cementing the rules of evaluation and 2) emphasizing that frames are opened only when functions are called, not when they are defined.
