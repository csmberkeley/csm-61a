To evaluate a variable name, we find its value from the first frame (current frame, parent, parent’s parent, …) where the variable is defined. The first time we assign (bind) a value to a variable, we declare a new variable in the current frame and bind to the respective value.

The \lstinline{nonlocal} keyword introduces more control over this process. The first time we assign a value to a \lstinline{nonlocal} variable, rather than declare a new variable in the current frame, we bind the value to the variable of the same name found in the first parent frame that contains such a variable. This means that this variable does not exist in the current frame. Note: you cannot declare variables in the global frame as \lstinline{nonlocal}.
