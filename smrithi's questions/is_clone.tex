You're part of a company that builds armies of robot clones from a single robot. When a robot is cloned, you can create two copies of it. The company uses trees to track how many robots are descended from each other.
Implement is_clone(t) which takes in a tree and checks if the tree is equally balanced on both sides.

\begin{lstlisting}
def is_clone(t):
	if t.is_leaf():
		return True
	if ___________:
		return False
	
	left, right = t.branches
	if not (is_clone(left) and is_clone(right)):
		return False
	
	def count_leaves(t):
		if t.is_leaf():
			return 1
		return sum(________)
	
	return count_leaves(left) == __________
\end{lstlisting}

Your teacher hides hints for the final exam in trees. However, they give you too many trees that it's hard for you to manually go through them and search for the hints. Implement a function find_hint(t) that mutates a tree t so that it only keeps the path which don't end in leaf nodes that say "Blank".
def find_hint(t):
	for b in ______:
		_________
	________ = [_____ for b in _______ if _______]
