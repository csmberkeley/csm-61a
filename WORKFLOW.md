# CSM 61A content workflow

## Pre-composition
Before you write the worksheet, you must review past semester's work
- Review previous semester's worksheets. 
    - In some cases, topics were covered on different dates and in different combinations. You'll have to review 
- Review stale branches and unmerged pull requests from previous semesters for possible improvements not reflected in `master`.*
- Review the issues.  

## Drafting
- Make a new branch of the format: `fa22/mentor02`. 
- Open a pull request of the same name. 

## Worksheet review
- See WORKSHEET_REVIEW.md. 

## Finalization
- Make the worksheets, and place them in your semester's folder in `src`. 
- Do not delete the branch at this point. 

## Post-section feedback
- Collect feedback from mentors through a Google form.
    - Write a new issue detailing these fixes. For each problem you critique, mention the canonical name of the problem (the name of the question file in `topics`). For example: `funky-funcs`.
    - If you have the bandwidth, you can fix particularly egregious problems at this point. However, under no circumstances should you change the final worksheet PDFs in the semester's folder. We're not here to rewrite history. 
- Close or merge all pull requests used for the worksheet, and then delete the branch. 

## *End of semester
Some previous semesters did not maintain this repository as well as they could have. We're going to do a better job of that. 
- At the end of the semester, all pull requests should be closed or merged, and all branches should be deleted.
