    This worksheet includes a very large number of problems because we essentially intend it to be a problem bank for any review activities you decide to do in section. You, of course, are free to ignore any and all of the problems we provide you and simply do exam problems, which is honestly what I would probably do if I were teaching a section this week. It's never too early to start preparing!
    \newline Also, note that the inheritance overview at the start of the worksheet is redundant with last week's. We included this as a refresher!
