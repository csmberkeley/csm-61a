    This worksheet includes a very large number of problems because we essentially intend it to be a problem bank for any review activities you decide to do in section. You, of course, are free to ignore any and all of the problems we provide you and simply do exam problems, which is honestly what I would probably do if I were teaching a section this week. 

    Note that students have not yet been exposed to mutable trees in CSM (though they have, of course, been exposed to this content in lecture). We have elected to include content on mutable trees in this week's worksheet. (Sorry.) While the timing on this is not ideal, students have already been exposed to immutable trees, so it shouldn't be the end of the world if they don't get to do it on this worksheet.

    Also note that there are no OOP problems on this worksheet. As it is dense enough, we prefer your students work on Linked Lists and Mutable Trees this section, though if your section wants to particularly examine OOP, we recommend doing Fall 2021 Midterm 2 Q3a as a quick refresher or, for more in-depth practice, Spring 2022 Final Q10.
    
    All problems after Trees are review for the midterm your students will have on Friday.
