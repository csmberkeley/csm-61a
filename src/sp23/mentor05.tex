\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tree recursion mini lecture: 8 minutes
    \item Gibonacci: 15 minutes -- skippable if your students feel especially comfortable with tree recursion; otherwise please do this.
    \item FizzBuzz: 8 minutes -- could be used as a step between Gibonacci and Selective Sum.
    \item Selective Sum: 10 minutes
    \item Has Sum: 10 minutes
    \item Mario Number: 10 minutes
    \item Collapse: 10--20 minutes
