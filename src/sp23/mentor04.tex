\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Higher-order environment and currying mini-lecture
    \item Recursion mini-lecture - 10 mins
    \item Wrong factorial - 5 to 10 mins
    \item All true - 10 mins
\end{itemize}
As a reminder, there is no expectation that you get through all problems in a section. Pick the most pertinent problems for your section.

        Generally only choose one of the two problems to work on, since they cover similar ground in terms of HOFs. These are on the harder side so also consider doing the rest of the worksheet and coming back.
