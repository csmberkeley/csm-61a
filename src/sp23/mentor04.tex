\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recursion Mini Lecture and Wrong Factorial: 15 minutes
    \item Selective Sum: 10 minutes
    \item is\_sorted and/or collapse: 10--20 minutes
    \item Mandelbrot: 20+ minutes, only do if your students are very comfortable with recursion
\end{itemize}
As a reminder, there is no expectation that you get through all problems in a section. Since is\_sorted and collapse are so similar, it is probably not necessary to get through both.
