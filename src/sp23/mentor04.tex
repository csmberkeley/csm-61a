\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compound OR Partial Summer: 15 minutes
    \item Selective Sum: 10 minutes
    \item is\_sorted and/or collapse: 10--20 minutes
    \item Mandelbrot: 20+ minutes, only do if your students are very comfortable with recursion
\end{itemize}
As a reminder, there is no expectation that you get through all problems in a section. Since is\_sorted and collapse are so similar, it is probably not necessary to get through both.

    \begin{questionmeta}
        Generally only choose one of the two problems to work on, since they cover similar ground in terms of HOFs. These are on the harder side so also consider doing the rest of the worksheet and coming back.
