\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tree Recursion Mini-lecture: 8 minutes
    \item Q1: Gibonacci: 15 minutes -- skippable if your students feel especially comfortable with tree recursion; otherwise, please do this.
    \item Q2: FizzBuzz: 8 minutes -- could be used as a step between Gibonacci and Selective Sum.
    \item Q3: Selective Sum: 10 minutes
    \item Q4: Has Sum: 10 minutes
    \item Q5: Mario Number: 10 minutes
    \item Q6: Collapse: 10--20 minutes
\end{itemize}
As a reminder, there is no expectation that you get through all problems in a section. Choose questions that will best benefit your students (temperature checks are a great way to do this!).
