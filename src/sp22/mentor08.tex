\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\newline
There are three big topics on this worksheet: representation, linked lists and trees. There are plenty of problems,
so poll your students about which topic to dive into; if no consensus, maybe present a little bit from each topic as time permits.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Representation
            \item Representation Mini Lecture - 8 min
            \item Representation WWPD - 10 min (No need to cover all of it)
        \item Tree
            \item Trees Mini Lecture - 5 min
            \item Tree Sum - 5 min
            \item Double Tree - 10 min
        \item Linked Lists
            \item Linked Lists Lecture - 10 min
            \item WWPD - 10 min
            \item Skip - 5 min
            \item Skip (no mutate) - 10 min
            \item Has Cycle - 10 min
