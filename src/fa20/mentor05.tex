\textbf{General Announcements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Attendance is \textbf{required} for the first 2 weeks of section. Please be vigilant about taking attendance in \href{scheduler.csmentors.org}{Scheduler}.
    \item Your students will have just taken their first midterm! Be positive and use these tips for teaching a \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oj0Cmm_HKPOU3YsdBWu1VDF2O1nLYBO_VWaczuGMc8g/edit}{post-midterm section}.

\textbf{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It can be hard to "think" recursively- try explaining it with diagrams and analogies.
    \item Make sure to factor in time for introductions - it’ll go a long way towards building your section’s tone and making your students feel comfortable. Don’t worry about it eating into your time too much.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start with a quick ice-breaker (name, major, year, why did you want to join CSM).
        \item Have students say a fun fact, respond to a quirky question, or try Woohoos \& Boohoos (one good thing and one bad thing from this week).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
