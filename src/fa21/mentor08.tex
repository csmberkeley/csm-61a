\begin{guide}
    You will likely not be able to finish all the problems in the time provided. Prioritize topics that your students want to practice, 
    and be aware that each section starts with introductory problems and builds up to more involved ones. Below are two possible 
    tracks, one with OOP focus and one with iterator \& generator focus. Unless your students are really comfortable with OOP, 
    try to prioritize OOP since it will be more relevant to Ants and the rest of the course content. Also, note that Hoop must be 
    solved before TeamBaller.
