\textbf{Diagnostic Quiz Notice}
    \newline
    The Diagnostic Quiz will be taking place today (Friday July 2nd), 5-6pm. As such, all tutorials after 5pm should be rescheduled or made optional.
    You should ask your students how to best support them for the quiz, and if possible, adapt the lesson plan to address their requests.
\end{guide}

\begin{guide}
\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\newline
For the normal recursion section, there are two options for a problem to cover. is\_sorted and collapse; the latter is more difficult.
If your students are still struggling with normal recursion, you can come back to discuss the second one at the end rather than moving
to the discussions problem. The second part of discussions is very difficult, so if your students are looking for an exam-level question
you can do that problem; otherwise, it is fine to skip.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recursion Mini Lecture or Sanity Check - 7 minutes
    \item wrong-factorial - 3 minutes
    \item is\_sorted or collapse - 10 minutes
    \item Tree Recursion Mini Lecture or Sanity Check - 5 minutes
    \item mario-number - 15 minutes
    \item discussions - If time permits
\end{itemize}
