\begin{guide}
    This semester 61A students aren't covering SQL, so we've split the final review worksheets into two parts. 
    This week covers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Environment Diagrams
        \item OOP
        \item Complexity
        \item Trees
        \item Generators
    \end{itemize}
    We will cover Scheme topics in the next worksheet! 

    \textbf{Recommended Timeline}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Environment Diagrams - 10 minutes
        \item DLL - 15 mins
        \item Complexity - 7 minutes
        \item Trees - 10 minutes
        \item Generator (pick one question) - 8 minutes 
        \item Answer any questions about the final - 5 minutes
    \end{itemize}
\end{guide}
