\textbf{First section teaching tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make sure to factor in time for introductions - it’ll go a long way towards building your section’s tone and making your students feel comfortable. Don’t worry about it eating into your time too much.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start with a quick ice-breaker (name, major, year, why did you want to join CSM).
        \item Have students say a fun fact, find something in common between all of you, or try Woohoos \& Boohoos (one good thing and one bad thing from this week).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Remember that 61A can be very overwhelming at the beginning, and your students will appreciate any guidance or advice you can offer them about your experience in the course.
    \item It can be hard to ``think'' recursively - try preparing some diagrams and analogies ahead of time.
\end{itemize}
\end{guide}
