        \item Lists Environment Diagram - 8 minutes
        \item All Primes or Duplicate List - 10 minutes
        \item Comprehensions - 5 minutes, no need to do all subparts unless students want the practice
        \item Dictionaries Mini Lecture + Count T - 10 minutes, there isn't a dictionaries intro but 
        remind students of dictionary basics before introducing the problem
        \item The Tree Recursion problem is there as extra practice outside of section. Feel free to go through it in section if your students feel more comfortable with lists
        and would prefer some more tree recursion practice. - 10-15 minutes.
