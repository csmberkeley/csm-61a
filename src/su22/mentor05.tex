	\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
	\begin{outline}[enumerate]
		\1 Mutability Mini Lecture - there are many list mutation methods. feel free to adjust time spent minilecturing on students' level of understanding - 5 minutes
		\1 \lstinline{wwpd-mutation} - check your understanding - 2-3 minutes
		\1 \lstinline{spooky-list} - really good, but difficult environment diagram to test students understanding - 10 minutes
		\1 \lstinline{accumulate} - coding question - 10 minutes
		\1 OOP Mini Lecture - classes, calling methods, class vs instance variables - 5 minutes
		\1 \lstinline{wwpd-starwars} - check your undersanding - 2-3 minutes
		\1 \lstinline{build-a-bear} - nice introduction it implementing a class - 5 minutes 
		\1 \lstinline{pingpong-tracker} - students will see ping pong on hw3, this question is the OOP version - 12 minutes
		\1 Optional Past Exam Questions
		\2 Mutability: Su19 MT Q3 and Sp19 Final Q2 - getting comfortable with environment diagrams, drawing box and pointers, visualizing list mutation operations
		\2 OOP: Fa19 Final Q5 - implementing classes, Su15 MT2 Q3 - implementing the init method, question works in dictionaries
		\1 Notes
		\2 this worksheet might be a little longer, so don't worry if you don't get to all the problems. The worksheets are a question bank!
		\2 students are most likely feeling very stressed about the midterm, give them some study and last min prep tips + comfort them
