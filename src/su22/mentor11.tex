    \textbf{Recommended Timeline}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reminders
        \begin{itemize}
            \item reminder that students don't need to know capturing groups
            \item students may not have seen aggregation in discussion yet
            Q2 and Q3 of the fish problem, and all of the outfits problem use aggregation
            feel free to skip those
        \end{itemize}
        \item Regex Intro and mini-lecture (7 minutes): reminder that students won't have to pick between re methods
        \item Q1 extracting (6 minutes): nice intro question but does use grouping and word boundaries
        \item Q2 linear functions (7 minutes): This one uses re.match with the anchors \lstinline{^} and \lstinline{$} to match the beginning and end of the input string.
        It would probably make more sense to use re.fullmatch without the anchors but I couldn't figure that one out.
        \item Q3 validate passwords (8 minutes): optional/if time allows (maybe cover SQL section of worksheet and come back to this if there's extra time leftover). The solution looks long but a lot of it is repetitive
        \item SQL Introduction and mini-lecture (5-10 min.): For best results, copy the corresponding 
        \texttt{mentor12.sql} database into code.cs61a.org so you can demonstrate queries using 
        the tables from this worksheet. You can also use the step-by-step feature to walk through queries.
        \item Fish Q1-3 (5-10 min.): These are good intro questions for students to be more comfortable writing queries. Again, Q2 and 3 here use aggregation but the aggregation here is simpler than for the outfits questions
        \item Fish Competitors (7 min.): Make sure to discuss joins and possibly give an example
        before letting students tackle this problem.
        \item Outfits: the queries aren't super meaningful since the tables are so small so you can tell students that their could be more rows than what's shown on the worksheet.
        Feel free to skip altogether if low on time.
