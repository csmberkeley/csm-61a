\begin{guide}
\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recursion Mini Lecture + Sanity Check - 5 minutes
    \item wrong-factorial - 3 minutes
    \item is\_sorted or collapse - collapse is the more difficult of the two. If students are still
    struggling with recursion, come back to collapse at the end - 10-15 minutes
    \item Tree Recursion Mini Lecture + Sanity Check - 5 minutes
    \item mario-number - this is a really good problem for tree recursion - 15 minutes
    \item discussions - the second part is very difficult [exam-level q] -  if time permits / feel free to skip
\end{itemize}
