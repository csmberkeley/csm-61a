    \textbf{Recommended Timeline}
    \begin{outline}[enumerate]
        \1 Iterators \& Generators Mini Lecture - 6 minutes
        \1 Interleave - question to ease into interators, introduces 'yield' and 'next(iter)' - 10 minutes
        \1 List Gen - question to ease into generators, introduces 'yield from' - 8 minutes
        \2 the concept of 'yield from' can be difficult. if students are confused, give them a little refresher (or simple example of its usage)
        \1 In Order - more difficult generator question, involves recursion - 8 minutes
        \2 if students are stuck, provide hints and leading questions to get them to the solution
        \2 ex. what do we do in ...this case? how do we ...do something?  
        \1 Efficiency Lecture - 5 min
        \1 Efficiency Problems - a few questions to introduce efficiency - 5 min
        \2 may be helpful to draw out diagrams, if students are stuck!
        \1 Post Midterm Thoughts
        \2 If students don't feel happy with their score, remind them that there's still time to improve
        \2 Full clobber policy this semester -- but students should understand the final will be difficult
        \2 Potentially talk about adjusting learning/studying styles -- setting realistic, tangible goals: i.e. review material for 30min every day
        \2 Building the intuition and gain familiarity with concepts takes time and lots of practice! It's totally normal to struggle. Still a few weeks left to learn and grow!!!
