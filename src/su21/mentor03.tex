\textbf{Diagnostic Quiz Notice}
    \newline
    The Diagnostic Quiz will be taking place today (Friday July 2nd), 5-6pm. As such, tutorial will be optional.
    Feel free to run your section in whatever way will help students feel most prepared for the quiz.
\end{guide}

\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\newline
For the normal recursion section, there are two options for a problem to cover. is\_sorted and collapse; the latter is more difficult.
If your students are still struggling with normal recursion, you can come back to discuss the second one at the end rather than moving
to copy-machine.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recursion Mini Lecture or Sanity Check - 7 minutes
    \item wrong-factorial - 3 minutes
    \item is\_sorted or collapse - 10 minutes
    \item Tree Recursion Mini Lecture or Sanity Check - 5 minutes
    \item mario-number - 15 minutes
    \item copy-machine - If time permits
\end{itemize}
\end{guide}
