    \textbf{Recommended Timeline}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tail Recursion Intro - 8 minutes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Feel free to go over questions 1 and 2 during your explanation.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \lstinline{count-instance} - 10 minutes
        \item \lstinline{filter} - 10 minutes
        \item \lstinline{decay} - 10 minutes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Skip this in favor of the challenge problem if your students are comfortable with Scheme
        \end{itemize}
        \item \lstinline{reverse} - 12 minutes
        \item \lstinline{max-depth} (Challenge) - 15 minutes
        \item Regex (Optional) - do not cover unless you have time \& your students really want to
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Regex is in scope for assignments, but out of scope for the final. This problem is included as extra practice for students on their own time.
        \end{itemize}
