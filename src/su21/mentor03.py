1. Mario needs to jump over a series of Piranha plants, represented as a string of 0’s and
1’s. Mario only moves forward and can either step (move forward one space) or jump
(move forward two spaces) from each position. How many different ways can Mario
traverse a level without stepping or jumping into a Piranha plant? Assume that every
level begins with a 1 (where Mario starts) and ends with a 1 (where Mario must end
up).

2. In an alternate universe, 61A software is not that good (inconceivable!). Laryn is in
charge of assigning students to discussion sections, but sections.cs61a.org only knows
how to list sections with either m or n number of students (the two most popular
sizes). Given a total number of students, can Laryn create sections and not have
any leftover students? Return true if they can, false otherwise.

3. Realizing the need for improvement, Laryn has recruited you to help them make 61A
sections more flexible! Laryn would like discussion sections to have 20 ≤ x ≤ 30
students each, and tutoring sections to have 6 ≤ y ≤ 8 students. Additionally, it’s
okay to have up to upper total slots, as long as we have at least lower amount to
accomodate all students. Is it possible to assign each student a section? (Note: In
this alternate universe, students can choose either a tutoring section or a discussion
section, but not both.)
