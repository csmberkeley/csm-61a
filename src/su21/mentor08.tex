\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linked Lists Review/Mini-Lecture - 4 min
    \item WWPD - 5 min
    \item Skip - 6 min
    \item Skip (no mutate) - 4 min: You may choose to >skip< this problem to spend more time on mutable trees (or, quickly walk through the solution so students are aware it exists).
    \item Has Cycle - 10 min
    \item Mutable Trees Review/Mini-Lecture - 5 min
    \item Tree Sum - 5 min
    \item Delete Path Duplicates - 7 min
    \item Replace Leaves Sum - 8 min
