\newline
The \texttt{zip} function takes in any number of iterables and returns an iterator of tuples. Each tuple contains the 
elements from each iterable at that index. For example, calling \texttt{zip([1, 2, 3], ["one", "two", "three"])} 
would return an iterator whose first value is the tuple \texttt{(1, "one")}. If we call \texttt{list()} on the 
returned iterator, we get \texttt{[(1, "one), (2, "two"), (3, "three")]}.
\end{guide}

\section{Dictionaries}
Dictionaries are data structures that map keys to values. In Python, the key-value pairs in a dictionary are unordered.
\begin{guide}
\newline
Make sure to emphasize the similarities and differences between dictionaries and lists. For example, like lists, you can 
add and retrieve items in dictionaries using indexing syntax. However, unlike lists, dictionaries do not have 
indices, so you must add and retrieve things using keys, like this: \texttt{dict[key] = value}.
