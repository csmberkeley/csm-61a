\begin{guide}
  This worksheet primarily covers functions, control, and environment diagrams, which have been covered and introduced in Tuesday and Wednesday's lecture, as well as Disc01 and Lab01.
  
  There is also a challenge problem (i.e. exam prep) at the bottom for if you finish early or your students are looking for something more difficult to try.
  
This is a fairly long worksheet so don't feel pressured to do all of the problems! Make sure to poll your students to see which problems they are more interested in covering.

Again, you probably won't be able to do all of them- but you can choose a few based on how long they are.
