\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
  \item SQL Introduction and mini-lecture (5-10 min.): For best results, copy the corresponding 
  \texttt{mentor12.sql} database into code.cs61a.org so you can demonstrate queries using 
  the tables from this worksheet. You can also use the step-by-step feature to walk through queries.
  \item Fish Q1-3 (5-10 min.): You may want to walk through some or all of 
  these problems yourself, as they are more straightforward than the rest of
  the worksheet. If you decide to let your students work on it themselves, there will
  probably not be enough time to finish some problems (which is ok).
  \item Fish Competitors (5 min.): Make sure to discuss joins and possibly give an example
  before letting students tackle this problem.
  \item Outfits (10-15 min.): Contains some more difficult aggregation problems.
  \item Circus (15 min.): More aggregation, and joining a table with itself.
