Bear class should have an attribute bears, a list that stores the name of each bear.

3. Letâ€™s use OOP to help us implement our good friend, the ping-pong sequence!
As a reminder, the ping-pong sequence counts up starting from 1 and is always either
counting up or counting down.
At element k, the direction switches if k is a multiple of 8 or contains the digit 8.
The first 30 elements of the ping-pong sequence are listed below, with direction swaps
marked using brackets at the 8th, 16th, 18th, 24th, and 28th elements:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [8] 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 [0] 1 [2] 1 0 -1 -2 -3 [-4] -3 -2 -1 [0] -1 -2
Assume you have a function has_eight(k) that returns True if k contains the digit 8.
