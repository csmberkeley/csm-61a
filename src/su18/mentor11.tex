\section{Creating Tables, Querying Data}
Examine the table, \texttt{mentors}, depicted below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c| }
 \hline
 \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Food} & \textbf{Color} & \textbf{Editor} & \textbf{Language} \\
 \hline
 Tiffany & Thai & Purple & Notepad++ & Java \\
 \hline
 Diana & Pie & Green & Sublime & Java \\
 \hline
  Allan & Sushi & Orange & Emacs & Ruby \\
 \hline
 Alfonso & Tacos & Blue & Vim & Python \\
 \hline
 Kelly & Ramen & Green & Vim & Python \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{questions}
\question Create a new table \textbf{mentors} that contains all the information above.
(You only have to write out the first two rows.)
\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
create table mentors as
    select 'Tiffany' as name, 'Thai' as food, 'Purple' as color, 'Notepad++' as editor, 'Java' as language union
    select 'Diana', 'Pie', 'Green', 'Sublime', 'Java' union
    select 'Allan', 'Sushi', 'Orange', 'Emacs', 'Ruby' union
    select 'Alfonso', 'Tacos', 'Blue', 'Vim', 'Python' union
    select 'Kelly', 'Ramen', 'Green', 'Vim', 'Python';
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

%%% Question %%%
\begin{blocksection}
\question Write a query that lists all the mentors along with their favorite food if their favorite color is green.\newline
Output:
\begin{lstlisting}
Diana|Pie
Kelly|Ramen
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
select m.name, m.food
  from mentors as m
  where m.color = 'Green';

Without aliasing:

select name, food
  from mentors
  where color = 'Green';
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\question Write a query that lists the food and the color of every person whose
favorite language is NOT Python. \newline
Output:
\begin{lstlisting}
Sushi|Orange
Pie|Green
Thai|Purple
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
select m.food, m.color
  from mentors as m
  where m.language <> 'Python';

Without aliasing:

select food, color
  from mentors
  where language != 'Python';
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}

%%% Question %%%
\begin{blocksection}
\question Write a query that lists all the pairs of mentors who like the same language. (How can we make sure to remove duplicates?) \newline
Output:
\begin{lstlisting}
Kelly|Alfonso
Tiffany|Diana
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[2in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
select m1.name, m2.name
    from mentors as m1, mentors as m2
    where m1.language = m2.language and m1.name > m2.name;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}


%%% Question %%%
\begin{blocksection}
\section{Fish Population}
The 61A mentors want to start a fish hatchery, and they need your help to analyze the data they've collected for the fish populations! Also, running a hatchery is expensive -- they'd like to make some money on the side by selling some seafood (only older fish of course) to make delicious sushi. \newline
\newline
The following table contains a subset of the data that has been collected. The SQL column names are listed in brackets. Note: we must be able to extend your queries to larger tables! (i.e, don't hard code your answers) \newline
\newline
Table name: \texttt{fish}*
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c| }
 \hline
 \textbf{Species} & \textbf{Population} & \textbf{Breeding Rate} & \textbf{\$/piece} & \textbf{\# of pieces per fish} \\
  \textbf{[species]} & \textbf{[pop]} & \textbf{[rate]} & \textbf{[price]} & \textbf{[pieces]} \\
 \hline
 Salmon & 500 & 3.3 & 4 & 30 \\
 \hline
 Eel & 100 & 1.3 & 4 & 15 \\
 \hline
  Yellowtail & 700 & 2.0 & 3 & 30 \\
 \hline
 Tuna & 600 & 1.1 & 3 & 20 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
*(This was made with fake data, do not actually sell fish at these rates)
\question \textbf{Aggregation} Hint: The aggregate functions \texttt{MAX}, \texttt{MIN}, \texttt{COUNT}, and \texttt{SUM} return the maximum, minimum, number, and sum of the values in a column. The  \texttt{GROUP BY} clause of a select statement is used to partition rows into groups.

\begin{parts}

\part Write a query to find the three most populated fish species.
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
select species from fish order by -pop LIMIT 3;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\part Profit is good, but more profit is better. Write a query to select the species that yields the most number of pieces for each price. Your output should include the species, price, and pieces.
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
select species, price, MAX(pieces) from fish GROUP BY price;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\end{blocksection}

\begin{blocksection}
\vspace{10px}
(c) Write a query to find the total number of fish in the "ocean." Additionally, include the number of species we summed. Your output should have the number of species and the total population.
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
select COUNT(species), SUM(pop) from fish;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\end{blocksection}

\begin{blocksection}

(d) Business is good, but a bunch of competition has sprung up! Through some cunning corporate espionage, we have determined that one such competitor plans to open shop with the following rates:\newline
\newline
Table name: \texttt{competitor}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
 \hline
 \textbf{Species} & \textbf{\$/piece} \\
  \textbf{[species]} & \textbf{[price]} \\
 \hline
 Salmon & 2 \\
 \hline
 Eel & 3.4 \\
 \hline
  Yellowtail & 3.2  \\
 \hline
 Tuna & 2.6  \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Write a query that returns, for each species, the difference between our hatcheryâs revenue versus the competitorâs revenue for one whole fish. For example, the table should contain the following row: \newline
\texttt{Salmon | 60} \newline \newline
We make 30 pieces of salmon at \$4 for a total revenue of \$120, whereas the competitor makes 30 pieces at \$2 a piece for a total revenue of \$60. The difference is \$60. Remember to do this for every species!
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
select fish.species, (fish.price - competitor.price) * pieces
    from fish, competitor
    where fish.species = competitor.species;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}


\end{blocksection}
