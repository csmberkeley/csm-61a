	\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
	\begin{itemize}
		% need to fix
		\item OOP Mini Lecture - classes, calling methods, class vs instance variables - 5 minutes
		\item \lstinline{wwpd-starwars} - check your understanding - 2-3 minutes
		\item \lstinline{build-a-bear} - nice introduction it implementing a class - 5 minutes
		\item \lstinline{reprtilia} - goes over str and repr! not too much of a biggie, but should help clarify - 2-3 minutes
		\item \lstinline{pingpong-tracker} - students will see ping pong on hw3, this question is the OOP version - 12 minutes
		\item Optional Past Exam Questions
		\item Mutability: Incredibles and WWPD - getting comfortable with environment diagrams, drawing box and pointers, understanding list mutation operations
		\item Notes
		\item this worksheet might be a little longer, so don't worry if you don't get to all the problems. The worksheets are a question bank!
		\item students are most likely feeling very stressed about the midterm, give them some study and last min prep tips + comfort them
