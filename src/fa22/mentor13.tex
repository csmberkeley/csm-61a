\textbf{Teaching Tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Before we jump into Macros, it is very important to ensure that your students understand quasiquotation.
    \item Take your time with the quasiquotation WWSD and drawing parallels with Python's f-strings may make it easier for your students to understand 
    \item Draw out box and pointer diagrams to show how the expressions in macros are being stored when the operands are unevaluated
    \item If you would like a quick refresher on how to think about macros, please refer to this link! \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JSbvtJ5bYUEhovDZd_gQnBvkG_WDcafmX-4B3QeIXZU/edit}{guide}
