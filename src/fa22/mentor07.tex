        Students should only do the Pokemon problem if they are uncomfortable with understanding the structure of data abstraction.
    \end{questionmeta}
    \begin{questionmeta}
        When introducing the Pokemon problem, feel free to create your own analogy in addition to the one given in the summary.

    \begin{questionmeta}
        A common analogy for data abstraction are: cars (the inside variables are engine, inner workings, outside are steering wheel and gas pedal).

        This is a hard question! Only do it if your students are absolutely assured in their definition of data abstraction and the abstraction barrier.
    \end{questionmeta}
    \begin{questionmeta}
        Feel free to spend even more time on this. Lists are more important for students generally, but understanding data abstraction deeply is a great setup for OOP!
