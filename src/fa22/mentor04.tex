\textbf{Recommended Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recursion Mini Lecture and Wrong Factorial: 15 minutes
    \item Selective Sum: 10 minutes
    \item Sum Prime Digits: 10 minutes
    \item is\_sorted or collapse: 10--15 minutes
    \item Mandelbrot: 20+ minutes, only do if your students are very comfortable with recursion
\end{itemize}
As a reminder, there is no expectation that you get through all problems in a section. If you're strapped for time, it's probably not necessary to do both selective sum and sum prime digits.
