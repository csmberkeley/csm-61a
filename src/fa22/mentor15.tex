\begin{guide}
    This is a bit of an unusual worksheet because it covers not one but two weeks. The SQL section should be covered in week 15, while the 
    remaining topics of final review should be covered during week 16. Students should make sure to keep the worksheet . 

    On the other hand, you could also just do various exam problems during week 16, which is probably what I would do if I were teaching a section.
