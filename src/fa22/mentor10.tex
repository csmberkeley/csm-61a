    \textbf{Recommended Timeline for Non-NPE Sections}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Efficiency Lecture - 5 min
        \item Efficiency Problems - 5 min
        \item Midterm Review (gauge what topics students want to brush up on and do those problems) - 40 min
        \item Also can use this time to finish problems from past worksheets!
    \end{itemize}
