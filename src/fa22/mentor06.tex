    This week, we're providing slides! Check them out in the content team folder. Feel free to use these while you mini-lecture, and make a copy and modify them if you'd like. 

    Teaching sequences can be tricky because there's a lot of material to cover, but it tends to be pretty boring ``this is how this works''-type content instead of deeper conceptual guides. So please, for the love of God, do not do a detailed mini-lecture on every aspect of sequences. This will take up far too much time and will probably not be a valuable experience for your students. Before mini-lecturing, it's valuable to ask your students what they would like you to go over specifically so that you're not repeating a bunch of information they already know.
