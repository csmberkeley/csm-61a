\section{Intro to Python}
\begin{questions}
\subimport{../../topics/basics/}{potpurri.tex}
\subimport{../../topics/basics/}{funky-funcs.tex}
\begin{questionmeta}
  It's probably not necessary to get through all the parts of this problem if your students get the idea. The last subpart is probably the most instructive. 
\end{questionmeta}
\end{questions}

\section{Control}
\begin{questions}
\subimport{../../topics/control/easy/}{divisible-by-4.tex}
\begin{questionmeta}
  The purpose of this problem is essentially to ensure that students are familiar with Python syntax. Its solution involves little complex thought. 
\end{questionmeta}
\subimport{../../topics/control/medium/}{find-max.tex}
\begin{questionmeta}
  The hardest part of this problem might be that students will overthink it, trying to find a ``clever'' way to do it with a smaller number of comparisons. 
\end{questionmeta}
\subimport{../../topics/control/medium/}{pow-of-2.tex}
\begin{questionmeta}
  If your students are not familiar with factorials, you may want to give them a brief overview before going over this problem. 
\end{questionmeta}
\subimport{../../topics/control/challenge/}{min_fact.tex}
\begin{questionmeta}
  This question differs significantly from a similar question that was used in past years. Please review it carefully before teaching it. 
\end{questionmeta}
\end{questions}
