\textbf{Teaching Tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Before we jump into macros, it is very important to ensure that your students understand quasiquotation.
    \item Draw out box-and-pointer diagrams to show how the expressions in macros are being stored when the operands are unevaluated, if needed.
    \item If you would like a quick refresher on how to think about macros, please refer to this \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JSbvtJ5bYUEhovDZd_gQnBvkG_WDcafmX-4B3QeIXZU/edit}{guide}.
