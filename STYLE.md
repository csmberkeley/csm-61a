# CSM 61A style guide
This document details preferred style for the creation of worksheets and worksheet problems.

## Worksheet document layout

## Problem layout
### Sectioning
There are two relevant sectioning commands used within CSM 61A problems: 
- `blocksection`: creates a spaced section that cannot be split over multiple pages
- `breakablesection`: creates a spaced section that cannot be split over multiple pages

## Miscellaneous style
### Spelling
- Use American spelling conventions in all cases. 

### Punctuation
- Oxford comma: use it in all cases.
- Use hyphens (-), en (–) dashes, and em dashes (—) as appropriate. Do not insert spaces around dashes. Do not use spaced hyphens such as in *I like Python - just not as a product language.* In LaTeX:
    - hyphens are typeset with one dash: `-`
    - en dashes are typeset with two dashes: `--`
    - em dashes are typeset with three dashes: `---`

### Dates
- Use full month names and cardinal numbers for dates. *November 24, 2022* is correct; *Nov. 24th, 2022* is not.
- En dashes (–) should be used for date ranges: *June 19–July 4*.
