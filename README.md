- Worksheets, which contain questions.
- Solutions, which contain questions and answers.
- Metas (formerly known as guides), which contains questions, answers, and information to help mentors teach the worksheet. 

Documentation for this repository is provided in the [Wiki](https://github.com/csmberkeley/csm-61a/wiki). The [Setup and Technical Details](https://github.com/csmberkeley/csm-61a/wiki/Setup-and-Technical-Details) is probably a good place to start.
